<h2 property="term:title">Singular Value Decomposition</h2>
<p property="term:description">
Singular value decomposition (SVD) is quite possibly the most widely-used multivariate statistical technique used in the atmospheric sciences.
The technique was first introduced to meteorology in a 1956 paper by Edward Lorenz, in which he referred to the process as empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis.
Today, it is also commonly known as principal-component analysis (PCA).  All three names are still used, and refer to the same set of procedures within the Data Library.
</p>

The purpose of singular value decomposition is to reduce a dataset containing a large number of values to a dataset containing significantly fewer values,
but which still contains a large fraction of the variability present in the original data.
Often in the atmospheric and geophysical sciences, data will exhibit large spatial correlations.  SVD analysis results in a more compact representation
of these correlations, especially with multivariate datasets and
can provide insight into spatial and temporal variations exhibited in the fields of data being analyzed.
<br /><br />

There are a few caveats one should be aware of before computing the SVD of a set of data.  First, the data must consist of anomalies.  Secondly, the data should be de-trended.
When trends in the data exist over time, the first structure often captures them.  If the purpose of the analysis is to find spatial correlations independent of trends, the
data should be de-trended before applying SVD analysis.
</div>
<div id="Analysis" class="ui-tabs-panel">
<h2>Analysis of Singular Value Decomposition</h2>
<p>
The first structure is the single pattern that represents the most variance in the data.
The structures are the elements of the eigenvectors of the variance-covariance matrix of the data.
In the Data Library, the eigenvectors are also known as EOF's.  The first eigenvector (EOF) points to the direction in which the data vectors jointly exhibit the most variability.
Essentially, a new coordinate system is created, with each axis aligned along the direction of maximum joint variability.
</p>
<p>
The second structure is the pattern that describes the second largest amount of variance, calculated the same way as the first structure. A very important property of the second structure is that it is completely uncorrelated with the first structure, as well as all other following structures.
The second eigenvector is perpendicular to the first eigenvector, which is perpendicular to the third eigenvector and so on.  This property is what led Lorenz to call the technique empirical <i>orthogonal</i> function analysis.
All structures are mutually uncorrelated.
</p>
<p>
The variance of the nth principal component is the nth eigenvalue.
Therefore, the total variation exhibited by the data is equal to the sum of all eigenvalues.
In the Data Library, eigenvalues are normalized such that the sum of all eigenvalues equals 1.
A normalized eigenvalue will indicate the percentage of total variance explained by its corresponding structure.
Structures have also been normalized so that the root mean square equals 1.  This way, the structures can be expressed in terms of standard deviation.
</p><p>
Singular values are equal to the square root of the eigenvalues.  Since eigenvalues are automatically normalized in the Data Library, they do not easily provide
information into the total amount of variance they explain.
However, you may calculate the total variance explained by each EOF by squaring the singular values.
</p>
<p>
In the Data Library there is a time series associated with each structure. These time series are also known as principal components.
The first time series is calculated by projecting the data matrix onto the first eigenvector of the variance-covariance matrix of the data, the
second time series by projecting onto the second eigenvector, and so on.
The time series values indicate the amount of the given structure needed to complete the data field.
It follows that the structure (dimensionless) multiplied by the time series value at a single point in time (units of the data),
summed over all structures, yields the original data at that point in time.
</p><p>
Mathematically, there are as many eigenvectors as there are elements in the vector data set.
The first few eigenvectors will point in directions where the data jointly exhibits large variation.
The remaining eigenvectors will point to directions where the data jointly exhibits less variation.
For this reason, it is often possible to capture most of the variation by considering only the first few eigenvectors.
The remaining eigenvectors, along with their corresponding principal components, are truncated.
The ability of SVD to eliminate a large proportion of the data is a primary reason for its use.

The first normalized eigenvalue is .233, the second eigenvalue is .151, and the third eigenvalue is .139.  Recall that normalized eigenvalues represent the fraction of variance explained
by the structure associated with that eigenvalue.  Therefore, the first structure explains 23% of the variance, the second structure 15%, and so on.  Looking at the table, there are 402 structures.  Yet, the first

This is an image of the 1st structure, which explains 23.2% of the total variance present in the original data.
Recall that the structures have been normalized, and as a result, are unitless quantities.
<!--Recall that the strucutres have been normalized so that they contain units of standard deviation.  Note the large negative SD values off the coast of West Africa.

Note the large negative values off the coast of West Africa.   This variability is caused by an ocean-atmosphere coupling system described in the third example.

This is an image of the second structure, which explains 15% of the total variance present in the original data.  Notice the large negative values off the east coast of the United States that extend into the Central Atlantic.
These large values may be produced, in part, by the Gulf Stream current, which causes annual variability of SST's in the region.  An image of the gulf stream current is provided below.  The large values present in the 2nd EOF structure above and the vectors that represent the gulf stream current in the image below appear to overlap.
This region is also aligned with the jet stream, a narrow area where weather patterns move off the coast and cause additional variability in SST's.
The large values in the 2nd structure may also be caused by an atmospheric circulation 
pattern known as the North Atlantic Oscillation.

The time series illustrates the amount of the structure present in the data, or in other words,
the amount of the structure needed to complete the data field at each time step.  These time series can be correlated with time series

This is an image of the first structure, which explains 40.2% of the total variance present 
in the original data. The large positive values centered around 45° N and the 
large negative values centered around 65° N are indicative of two regions whose 
mean sea level pressures are generally inversely related.  This system is a well known 
low-frequency atmospheric circulation pattern called the North Atlantic Oscillation.  The 
NAO is characterized by large-scale MSLP variablity associated with a subtropical high / 
polar low system over the Northern Atlantic.  During a postive NAO, the subtropical high is 
stronger than usual and the polar low is deeper than usual.  The increased pressure gradient
causes stronger winter storms to cross over the Atlantic.  During a negative NAO, the 
subtropical high and polar low are both weaker than usual, resulting in fewer / less severe 
storms crossing the Atlantic.

We can conclude there is a slight correlation between MSLP anomalies and  SST anomalies in the North Atlantic.
The correlation coefficient is not very high because correlations between the 1st SST anomaly strucuture, for example, can be found in multiple MSLP anomaly structures.  SVD analyses of the MSLP and SST datasets are independent of each other.
There is no guarantee that the maximum amount of association between two variables will be found in two distinct principal component analysis time series.
<br /><br />
However, it has been proven that there is a relationship between these two datasets, specifically between these two structures.  Atmospheric anomalies do cause SST anomalies, and vice versa.  In this example, changes in MSLP sometimes cause an anomalous atmospheric cyclonic circulation
centered around 40° W and 30° N.  The cyclone weakens the normal northerly winds off the west coast of Africa.  As a result, coastal upwelling is reduced and positive SST anomalies occur.  Scroll up the page to the first EOF structure in the first example.  Notice the
extremely low values off the coast of West Africa.  This SST variability is associated with variations in MSLP that produce the anomalous low.

<h2>Disadvantages of Unrotated Singular Value Decomposition</h2>
Unrotated emperical orthogonal functions (EOFs) are often very useful to describe natural modes of variability in a data field, due to their spatial and temporal orthogonality, ability to extract the maximum variance from a field, and relative
simplicity.
Yet, unrotated emperical orthogonal functions generally do a poor job of isolating individual modes of variation.
This weakness is largely due to four inherent characteristcs of unrotated EOFs: domain shape dependence, subdomain instability, sensitivity to sampling, and an inaccurate portrayal of the physical relationships embedded within the input data (Richman 1986).
<br />
<ol>
<li><u>Domain Shape Dependence</u><br /><br />
Unrotated EOFs can be primarily determined by the shape of the domain rather than by the covariation of the data.
In these cases, structures of the unrotated EOF analysis do not resemble any of the single input patterns, but rather, they represent combinations of the input patterns.<br /><br /></li>


<li><u>Subdomain Instability</u><br /><br />
Unrotated EOFs usually exhibit poor subdomain stability, where subdomain instability refers to the stability of the modal patterns as sub-portions of the domain.
Richman and Lamb (1985) did a study where unrotated EOF analyses were performed on the same set of data, once over an entire domain and once over the northern and southern halves of the domain separately.
The results for each half of the domain did not correspond with the results of the entire domain, which leads to the question:  How robust are the results from an unrotated EOF?<br /><br /></li>

<li><u>Sensitivity to Sampling</u><br /><br />
When eigenvalues are close together, they may be dominated by noise and the corresponding EOFs may not be well defined.<br /><br /></li>

<li><u>Lack of Physical Meaning</u><br /><br />
Unrotated EOFs sometimes produce results that are not physically meaningful.<br /><br /></li>
</ol>
<!--
The basis of domain shape dependence is that in many cases, unrotated EOFs are primarily determined by the shape of the domain and not by the covariation of the data.
In these cases, structures of the unrotated EOF analysis do not resemble any of the input patterns, but rather, the structures represent combinations (a merging) of the input patterns.
Subdomain instability refers to the stability of the modal patterns as sub-portions of the domain are examined.  Unrotated EOFs usually exhibit poor subdomain stability.
Richman and Lamb (1985) did a study where unrotated EOF analyses were performed on the same set of data, once over an entire domain and once over the northern and southern halves of the domain separately.
The results for each half of the domain did not correspond with the results of the entire domain, which leads to the question: Which of the patterns represent the correct mode of variability?
Sampling errors occur when the eigenvalues are close together.  When this happens, the eigenvalues may only represent noise and the corresponding EOFs may not be well defined.
Lastly, unrotated EOFs sometimes produce results that are not intuitively meaningful in a meteorological sense.

<div id="Rotate" class="ui-tabs-panel">
<h2>Rotated Singular Value Decomposition</h2>
<p>In a rotated EOF analysis, the eigenvectors are weighted by the square root of their corresponding eigenvalues, so that the weights (i.e., loadings) represent
the correlations between each variable and principal component.  Most rotations are simple expressions which approximate a simple structure through the application
of mathematical algorithms which distribute the PC loadings such that the dispersion of the loadings is maximized.
</p>

Varimax rotation is the most widely accepted method for analytical rotation.  The Varimax method reduces variances of the projection of the data onto the rotated basis, where the projection is the principal component time series.
This improves the alignment of the basis with the actual data and improves the relationship between their spatial and temporal patterns and known physical mechanisms.  Varimax is a method for rotating the axes of a plot such that the eigenvectors remain orthogonal as they are rotated.
These rotations are used in principal component analysis so that the axes are rotated to a
position in which the sum of the variances of the loadings is the maximum possible (Oilfield Glossary).
In the Data Library, the varimax function requires the user to specify the number of eigenvectors to use in the rotation.
The matrix of loadings is determined by the truncated eigenvectors.<br /><br />

Many atmospheric scientists argue that rotated EOF analysis is a more effective tool than unrotated EOF analysis for the study of atmospheric circulation patterns.
While EOF rotation is often very useful, it is not meant to be a default operation after every EOF analysis.
The application of actual EOFs should be guided by the specific analysis.

<p>
The first structure is representative of the El Niño Southern Oscillation.
Recall that the first structure is the pattern that explains the most variability in the 
original set of data.
The relatively large positive values located immediately off the west coast of South America 
correspond to the
variability in SSTs caused by upwelling during La Niño years and the lack of 
upwelling during El Niño years.
</p><p>
Notice that these values extend westward in a narrow line, and as a result, do not cover much surface area in the Pacific.
However, ENSO generally effects a greater area than depicted by this first structure.  One explanation is that part of the ENSO pattern might be contained
in another strucuture, or multiple structures.

By rotating the first three eigenvectors via the varimax method, the resulting structure is more representative of the
physical pattern (ENSO) than the unrotated EOF structure illustrated earlier in the example.  Pieces of the ENSO pattern contained in the multiple unrotated principal components have been incorporated
into one rotated component.  The negative values now extend farther north and south, as
well as to the west.  Many times, rotating the EOFs / PCs will result in a solution that better explains the underlying physical patterns in the input data.
