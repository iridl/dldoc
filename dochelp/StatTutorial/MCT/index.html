<h2 property="term:title">Measures of Central Tendency</h2>
<p property="term:description">
One of the most common quantities used to summarize a set of data is its center.
The center is a single value, chosen in such a way that it gives a reasonable approximation of normality.</p>
<p>
There are many ways to approximate the center of a set of data. One of the most familiar 
and useful measures of center is the mean,
however, using only the mean to approximate normality can often be misleading.
To obtain a better understanding of what is considered normal,
other measures of central tendency such as the median, the trimmed mean, and the 
trimean may be utilized in addition to the mean.
</p>
</div>
<div id="Mean" class="ui-tabs-panel">
<h2>Mean</h2>
<ul>
   <li>Defined as the arithmetic average of the set.</li>
   <li>Calculated by summing <i>all</i> values, then dividing by the number of values.</li>
   <li>One of the simplest measures of center to calculate.</li>
   <li>May provide an incomplete description of the central tendency if not accompanied 
by other measures.</li>
   <li>Greatly affected by extreme values.</li>

The spatial median time series looks similar to the spatial average time series from the previous example.  Yet, even though the two images look similar, they are not identical.
In a non-symmetrical dataset such as this, the median is different from the mean.

A certain estimate of the center is never considered to be "wrong" or "right". 
It is an approximation based on a given set of data and parameters. The 
probability that the exact value aligns perfectly with the estimated value is extremely 
low. Nevertheless, some estimates will be closer to the actual value than others.



<!--
From a climatological perspective, the most fundamental statistical function is the mean.  However, there are many caveats to be aware of when performing the basic function of calculating the mean.


The computed mean is not a completely reliable estimate of the climate system's true long-term mean state.
Observations used to compute the mean are only taken over a limited observing period, at discrete times and varying locations.
The mean may also be affected by instrumental or human errors.
Unreliability can also stem from data that has been analyzed.  Analyzed data has been interpolated to a regular grid using techniques that incorporate the laws of atmospheric dynamics.
The interpolation can either be performed subjectively by a human, or objectively by a combination of atmospheric models.  Subjective and objective interpolation both introduce error not present in the raw station data.

The mean state is not a typical state.  In many cases, the long-term mean masks a great deal of interperiod variability.
In these cases, we would expect to see the spatial variability within each period to be larger than that of the long-term mean.
Therefore, the long-term mean field would not be a typical field, since it is very unlikely to be observed for a given period.  In this sense, the long-term mean is a rare event.

Lastly, a climatological mean is a moving target. The climate of today is different than the climate 500 years ago, which was different than the climate 6000 years ago.
It is important to get a clear understanding of what the "true" mean state of the atmosphere is before interpreting the calculated mean from a set of observations.
As long as the set of data is stationary and the memory of the time series is short relative to the length of the sample, it is safe to assume that the dataset consists of a random set of elements.

If the conditions listed above are met, the mean state is considered to be representative of the random sample.  In other words, the mean lies in the center of the scatter of individual points in the state space.
However, the mean is not necessarily representative of the typical state, as illustrated earlier.
The sample mean becomes an increasingly better estimator of the long-term mean as the number of elements in the sample increases.
Calculating the mean January 500 hPa height field, for example, using a 15-year sample would produce considerable uncertainty while using a 50-year sample would be more accurate.
The interval at which data is taken is also an important factor to consider.  The mean of 100 surface air pressure readings taken at one-minute intervals at a given station is not a reliable estimator of the long-term mean air pressure at that station.
Air pressure does not vary greatly on one-minute time scales. Instead, taking the mean of 100 surface air pressure readings at weekly intervals would provide a more adequate representation of the typical mean state.

A certain estimate of the center is never considered to be wrong or right. It is an approximation, a guess, given a certain set of data and parameters. The probability that the exact value aligns perfectly with the estimated value is extremely low.
Nevertheless, some estimates will be closer to the actual value than others.

This value, 3.169257 mm/day, represents the mean July precipitation per day in the region from 10E  to 25W and from the equator to 30N.
Look again at the image of average July rainfall over the spatial grid (see above).
There are a few locations on the border of wet and dry with daily rainfall near 3.17 mm/day, yet, it is not a typical value for the region.
In most places, the location is either wet (above 4 mm/day), or it is dry (below 2 mm/day).
This example illustrates that the mean state is not necessarily the typical state of the system.
