There are three ways to locate data within the Data Library: 1) a listing of some of 
the datasets by category;  2) a complete list of datasets according to their source; and 3) a 
keyword search powered by Google.</p>
<p> Let's look at each one 
of these individually.
</p>
</div>
<div id="Category" class="ui-tabs-panel">
<h2>Datasets By Category</h2>
<p>
<span class="instruct">Select the "Datasets by Category" link.</span> 
<font size="-1"><a href="/docfind/databrief/">CHECK</a></font>
<br /><span class="t">This data discovery option provides a sorted listing of nearly all the datasets 
in the Data Library based on the type of data they contain. A summary of each dataset, including 
a brief description, spatial and temporal resolutions, and spatial and temporal limits, is also 
offered.  Feel free to browse the data categories. Note that the dataset names are also links 
to the datasets themselves.</span>
</p>
</div>
<div id="Source" class="ui-tabs-panel">
<h2>Datasets By Source</h2>
<p>
<span class="instruct">Select the "Datasets by Source" link in the blue banner.</span>
<font size="-1"> <a href="/SOURCES/">CHECK</a></font>
<br /><span class="t">This is a complete list of the datasets in the Data Library organized by 
their source. This method of finding datasets is typically utilized by users who are more 
familiar with climatic data and the providers that make it available. Below
the "Datasets and variables" heading you see the list of sources and either
a brief description of the source or a list of the subsections of data
from that source. For example, let's take a closer look at one of
the largest contributors of data to the Data Library, the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).</span>
</p><p>
<span class="instruct">Scroll down to the "NOAA" link.</span>
<br /><span class="t">You can see that there are five subsections of data from NOAA. 
These include the National Oceanic Data Center (NODC), National Geophysical Data Center 
(NGDC), National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP), NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis Project 
(NCEP-NCAR), and the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC).</span>
</p><p>
<span class="instruct">Select the "NOAA" link.</span>
<br /><span class="t">You can now see these same five
subsections as links to more data. We can get to the same NOAA NCEP
CPC GLOBAL monthly STATION dataset main page that we looked at before by
selecting the proper source links here.</span>
</p><p>
<span class="instruct">Select the "NCEP" link.
<br />Select the "CPC" link.
<br />Select the "GSOD" link.
<br />Select the "MONTHLY" link.</span>
<font size="-1"><a href="/SOURCES/.NOAA/.NCEP/.CPC/.GSOD/.MONTHLY/">CHECK</a></font>
<br /><span class="t">We are now back at the NOAA NCEP
CPC GSOD MONTHLY dataset main page. Again, note the source
bar. It has the same series of links that we saw before and represents
the same steps we took from the Dataset by Sources page to get here.</span>
</p><p>
<div class="t">Note the blue navigation banner
again. Remember we talked about the links changing in the banner
to represent the hierarchy of the current page? The banner on this
page is an excellent example. We are in the Datasets by Source
partition of the Finding Data section off the main Data Library page.
You can find links from each of these hierarchical levels on the banner.
Use this navigation banner to help yourself remain oriented as you move
through the Data Library.</div></p>
</div>
<div id="Searching" class="ui-tabs-panel">
<h2>Datasets By Searching</h2>
<p>
<span class="instruct">Select the "Data Library" link in the navigation banner.
<br />Select the "Dataset Searches" link.</span> <font size="-1"><a href="/docfind/searches/">CHECK</a></font>
</p><p class="t">This is a popular option for those who know exactly what dataset they want, but 
don't know where it is in the Data Library, as well as for those who are not sure what they are 
looking for at all. The hints listed on this page are valuable and worthy of a bit more discussion.
</p><p>
<i>1. If you are looking for data from weather station reports, then include the 
word "station" as one of your keywords.</i>
</p><p>
The Data Library includes data from weather stations as well as gridded data. While searching 
with the word "station" often locates station data, including the word "grid" in a search will 
not effectively locate gridded datasets as it is commonly used on the pages of both types of 
datasets.
</p><p>
Entering the specific name of your desired station as a keyword will not help your search either. 
For example, suppose you want to find precipitation data for a station in Seattle.
</p><p>
<span class="instruct">Enter the keywords "precipitation Seattle".</span> 
<br /><span class="t">There are no matches for that search. However, this does not mean that the Data 
Library does not contain any datasets with precipitation data for Seattle.</span>
</p><p>
<span class="instruct">Enter the keywords "precipitation station".</span>
<br /><span class="t">You have now found a handful of datasets that contain station-reported 
precipitation data. Data from specific stations (e.g., Seattle) can be located after a 
dataset is selected and we will discuss how to do that in 
<a href="/dochelp/Tutorial/Selection/Stations_Regions/#Station_Single">Part II</a></span>.
</p><p>
<i>2. If you are looking for a particular variable, then include the variable name as one of 
your keywords.</i> 
<br />As in the example above, we included "precipitation" as a keyword in our search for 
precipitation data.
</p><p>
You may also find it valuable to use your desired temporal resolution as a keyword as well. 
For example, suppose you want to find daily data of maximum temperature.
</p><p>
<span class="instruct">Enter the keywords "maximum temperature monthly".</span> 
<br /><span class="t">This search yields a list primarily consisting of datasets that contain monthly data of 
maximum temperature. Note the difference compared to the search results if you are looking for 
daily temperature data.</span>
</p><p>
<span class="instruct">Enter the keywords "maximum temperature daily".</span>
<br /><span class="t">This technique will have different results for different variables, but it 
may be worth a try if you know your desired temporal resolution. Because this is not a fool-proof
method, you should always confirm the temporal resolution of any dataset
you find in this manner by noting its time grid. A more descriptive
discussion of <a href="/dochelp/Tutorial/Datasets/Structure#Grids">grids</a> is in a subsequent section.</span>
</p><p>
<div class="t"><u>Making sense of the search results</u>
<br />Selecting a dataset from the search results is generally straightforward, 
but it could be made more clear with a brief discussion. All of the instruction in Part II 
will begin from a dataset main page. Therefore, the following discussion describes
how to get to a dataset main page from the different kinds of pages that
may appear in your search results. Let's use the search results for "maximum temperature 
daily" as an example. One of options in the search results is NOAA NCDC DAILY FSOD TMAX.</div>
</p><p>
<span class="instruct">Select this link in the search results or you can reach it by clicking 
<a href="http://ingrid.ldeo.columbia.edu/SOURCES/.NOAA/.NCDC/.DAILY/.FSOD/.TMAX/" target="new">here*</a>. 
</span><font size="-1"><a href="http://ingrid.ldeo.columbia.edu/SOURCES/.NOAA/.NCDC/.DAILY/.FSOD/.TMAX/">CHECK</a></font>
<br /><div class="t">This is a dataset variable page. Specifically, it is the maximum temperature variable 
page of the NOAA NCDC DAILY FSOD TMAX dataset. While you may want to use maximum 
temperature data, it is often best to start your work from a dataset main page where you have the opportunity 
to select any of the variables available in that datatset. In this case, we want to start from the 
NOAA NCDC DAILY FSOD TMAX main page. There are numerous ways to reach a main page from a variable page. 
This time we will use the <a href="/dochelp/Tutorial/Datasets/Structure#Source Bar">source bar</a> near the top of the page. The source bar is 
the series of links that describes the dataset and variable that is currently selected. You will see this bar 
on all of the pages in the Data Library.</div>
</p><p>
<span class="instruct">Select the "FSOD" link in the source bar.</span>
<font size="-1"><a href="http://ingrid.ldeo.columbia.edu/SOURCES/.NOAA/.NCDC/.DAILY/.FSOD/">CHECK</a></font>
<br /><span class="t">You are now on the NOAA NCDC DAILY FSOD main page. Note how the 
source bar on this page is different from the one on the dataset variable page.
Here, on the dataset main page, no variable has been selected so the lowest
level link on the source bar is the dataset itself.</span>
</p><p>There are other types of pages that
may be included in search results, such as dataset help, outline, and documentation pages. 
You can always find your way back to the associated dataset main page with
the source bar links or by using the blue navigation banner in the upper left corner.
This banner appears on all of the Data Library pages. The specific links on the banner will change as 
you move through the Data Library and will always be dictated by the hierarchy of the current page. Simply 
click on the link that says "dataset" in white. Sometimes there may be a link that says "documention" in white
instead, like it does on the current NOAA NCDC DAILY FSOD page. That link will take to the dataset documentation 
and then a white "dataset" link will appear.
