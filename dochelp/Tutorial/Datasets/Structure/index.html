<p property="term:description">You should now be more comfortable
with finding datasets in the Data Library. Let us take a closer look
at the information and utilities available to you when you select a dataset. You will not 
use these utilities in this section, but it is important to know what they do and where they 
are for Parts II and III. The NOAA NCDC DAILY FSOD dataset is a commonly used dataset and 
is the example for this section.</p>
<p class="instruct">Select <a href="/SOURCES/.NOAA/.NCDC/.DAILY/.FSOD/" target="new">NOAA
NCDC DAILY FSOD*</a>.</p>
<br /><div class="t">There is a wealth of information
about the dataset on its main page. Let's look at all of the elements
from top to bottom.</div>

The function bar has its greatest utility after the desired data variable and station(s) 
or region have been selected, however it is important to be aware of what options are available.  
Therefore, a brief explanation of these tools is offered here. (Note that the links 
in the example above are inactive.)
<p>
<u>Views</u>: The views icons on the left side of the function bar take you to an image of the 
selected data and a data viewer similar to that seen on this page. Let's quickly go over the different 
types of images seen here.  The colored and contoured images generally display a spatial 
(e.g., [X,Z], [lon,lat]) image as either colors or contours.  The line graph typically illustrates a 
time series (e.g., [data value,T]) image. Other types of views icons will appear depending on your 
data selection.  It is important to remember that the image in the icon is representative of the image 
to which the icon is linked.  We will talk much more about these links and their visualization capabilities 
in <a href="/dochelp/Tutorial/MVD/Visualization/">Part III</a>.
</p><p>
<div class="instruct">Select the "Expert Mode" link.</div>
<br /><u>Expert Mode</u>: This option switches the interface into a mode that allows you to 
enter data-manipulating Ingrid commands directly rather than clicking on a series of pages to perform 
an identical task. 
You must not already be familiar with Ingrid at this point.  These commands will be introduced 
throughout the tutorial.
</p><p>
When in Expert Mode there is a list of active datasets at the top of the page and a 
text window containing the command equivalent of the current page where the commands 
can be edited. Right now, you should see only one dataset, FSOD, noted as the active dataset. 
Because no variable has been selected, you can see all of the possible variables listed 
in this location as well. Much more detail about expert mode, including specific examples, will be
given in Parts <a href="/dochelp/Tutorial/Selection/">II</a> and 
<a href="/dochelp/Tutorial/MVD/">III</a>.</p>
</p><p>
<div class="instruct">Select the "Data Selection" link.</div>
<br /><div class="t"><u>Data Selection</u>: This option allows you to pick out a subset of the full dataset. 
Right now this option displays the available data variables that you also see on the dataset
main page. In Part II, you will learn how to use this option to select data for specific locations 
and time periods.</div>
</p><p>
<div class="instruct">Go back to the dataset main page by selecting the "FSOD" link in the source bar 
or the dataset link in the navigation banner.
<br />Select the "Data Downloads &amp; Files" link.</div>
<br /><div class="t"><u>Data Downloads &amp; Files</u>: This option allows you to download the dataset 
in a variety of formats. You will learn much more about this option in 
<a href="/dochelp/Tutorial/MVD/Download/">Part III</a>.</div>
</p><p class="instruct">Go bac k to the dataset main page by selecting the "FSOD" link in the source 
bar or the dataset link in the navigation banner.
<br />Select the "Data Tables" link.</p>
<br /><u>Data Tables</u>: This option allows you to view the data as a table in a 
variety of formats. You will learn much more about this option in Part III.
</p><p>
The function bar is largely used to select, manipulate, and visualize data and will therefore 
be covered in much greater detail in Parts II and III. Keep in mind that many of the contents 
of the links in the function bar will appear signifcantly different after you have selected your 
data variable and station(s) or region.  The goal here was just to introduce you the options 
available in the function bar.</p>

bar or the dataset link in the navigation banner.</div>

The source bar, as described in the previous section, indicates to the user the 
location of the current dataset in the Data Library and offers the opportunity to go to any of
the higher levels in the hierarchy by selecting one of the links. For example, you can view 
other NCDC datasets by selecting the "NCDC" link and other daily NCDC datasets 
by selecting the "DAILY" link. You should also notice the asterisk next to last link in the
dataset path. This indicates that the documentation for the dataset
is available and you can go to it by selecting the asterisk link.
</p><p>
The source bar is an extremely valuable navigation tool in the Data Library. Try using its options...
</p>
<p>
<div class="instruct">Select the "NCDC" link in the source bar.</div>
<br /><div class="t">These are the other subsets of data available from NCDC.</div>
</p><p>
<div class="instruct">Go back to the FSOD dataset main page (back button).
<br />Select the "*" link in the source bar.</div>
<br /><div class="t">This the documentation for the FSOD dataset.</div>
</p><p>
<div class="instruct">Go back to the FSOD dataset main page.</div>
<br />
</p><p><a NAME="Viewer"></a><span class="tb"><u>Dataset Map/Data Viewer</u></span>
<br /><span class="t">A dataset map will appear when the selected dataset is comprised of station data. 
Those datasets with gridded data will have a main page with an identical structure with
the exception of this map. For example, look at the main page for the 
<a href="/SOURCES/.NOAA/.NCEP-NCAR/.CDAS-1/.MONTHLY/.Diagnostic/" target="new2">NOAA
NCEP-NCAR CDAS-1 MONTHLY Diagnostic*</a> dataset, which is a gridded dataset. You should 
note the options and structure of this page are identical to those of the FSOD dataset, 
with the exception of the dataset map.</span>
</p><p>
<span class="t">The data viewer is an interactive interface that helps you find data for a specific location. 
The black dots on the map represent stations for which there is data in the dataset. The FSOD 
dataset primarily contains data from the United States and you can see that by the density of 
dots in the United States on the dataset map. You can select any of those stations by clicking 
on them. However, that may not be easy if the stations are as dense as they are here. Therefore, 
there a few options that make finding specific station(s) easier. First, you can zoom in on the 
map using the Zoom pull-down menu on the left side.</span>
</p><p>
<div class="instruct">Select a zoom magnitude from the Zoom pull-down.
<br />Click "Redraw".</div>
<br /><div class="t">You can also limit the map by selecting latitude and longitude values and place 
labels on the map to help you identify stations.</div>
</p><p>
<div class="instruct">Select new lat/lon limits and click "Redraw".
<br />Select one of the label methods in the pull-down menu on the right side. Its default says "no labels".
<br />Click "Redraw".</div>
<br /><div class="t">These options can be combined to easily select any number of stations. There is 
also a "Searches" link on the dataset map that will allow you to search for stations in a number 
of ways. These methods will be highlighted and fully discussed in the 
<a href="/dochelp/Tutorial/Selection/">next section</a>.</div>
</p><p class="instruct">Go back to the default dataset map by clicking on the "FSOD" link in the source bar.
</p><p>
<div class="tb"><u>Documents</u></div>
<span class="instruct">Select the "outline" link. </span><font size="-1"><a href="/SOURCES/.NOAA/.NCDC/.DAILY/.FSOD/outline.html">CHECK</a></font>
<br /><div class="t">This is one way to view the available variables within the dataset. The bracketed 
text with each variable indicates the grids that are associated with that variable. The idea
of grids will be addressed <a href="#Grids">later in this section</a>.</div>
</p><p>
<span class="instruct">Go back to the dataset main page.
<br />Select the "dataset documentation" link. </span><font size="-1"><a href="/SOURCES/.NOAA/.NCDC/.DAILY/.FSOD/.dataset_documentation.html">CHECK</a></font>
<br /><div class="t">This is the same documention for the FSOD dataset that reached via the 
"*" in the source bar and the "NOAA NCDC DAILY FSOD documentation" link in the blue 
navigation bar.</div>
</p><p>
<div class="instruct">Go back to the dataset main page.</div>
</p><p>
<span class="tb"><u>Datasets and variables</u></span>
<br /><span class="t">This is the same list of variables that you saw on the outline page. There is a link to each 
variable, as well as the abbreviated name of the variable in the dataset, and its grids (in 
brackets). You may notice that in this list the grids are time and WBAN instead of time and 
station as on the outline page. WBAN and station are synonymous- WBAN are the ids for stations. 
(Note: IWMO is another type of station ID and you may therefore see it in the station grid 
descriptions of other datasets.)</span>
</p><p>
<span class="t">You may chose a variable from this list, but it is often easier to select the station(s) or 
region first. Right now, let's just look to see what information is available when we select a 
variable.</span>
</p><p class="instruct">Select the pressure variable.</p>
<p>This is the typical information given for each variable. You are given the 
specific information about the grids as well as how the data are scaled, how missing values 
are replaced, and the units of the data.
</p><p>
<div class="instruct">Go back to the dataset main page.</div>
</p><p>
<a NAME="Grids"></a><span class="tb"><u>Grids</u></span>
<br /><span class="t">You can think of grids as the ways in which the data are dependent. In this example, 
the data vary with each station as well as with time. The information after each grid
indicates the units and range of the grid. For example, the time grid has units of julian 
days and has data from 1 Jan 1869 through 31 Dec 1999, which creates 47846 different time 
grid points. (Note: month is another common temporal grid unit.)</span>
</p><p>
Grids vary from dataset to dataset, but there is a fundamental difference between those for 
station data and those for gridded data.
</p><p>
<span class="instruct">Select <a href="/SOURCES/.NOAA/.NCEP/.CPC/.GLOBAL/.daily/" target="new2">NOAA
NCEP CPC GLOBAL daily*</a> here.</span>
<br />This is a gridded dataset and, accordingly, it has latitude and longitude 
grids instead of a station grid. You can see this in the grid brackets with the Daily OLR 
variable as well as in the information below the Grids heading. The description of the latitude and longitude 
grid gives the spatial resolution of the data as well as the spatial range and number of grid 
points in each direction.
<br /><div class="instruct">Close NOAA NCEP CPC GLOBAL daily.</div>
